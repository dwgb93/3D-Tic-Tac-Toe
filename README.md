# 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe
Just like regular Tic-Tac-Toe, but spoopier. And it'll kick your ass.

The 2nd time dipping my toes in tic-tac-toe AI, this time from sophomore year and using a REAL language. 

After making two-player 3DTTT, we were told to just play games for a week, figuring out the optimal strategy, then code it up. In the end, we ended up facing each of our programs against each other in a 3D tic-tac-toe tournament. Mine won!

Unlike 2D tic-tac-toe, where the 2nd player can force a tie, in 3D tic-tac-toe the first player can force a win by taking the centre then two corners. This opens up a potential three-way fork that can't be blocked. A senior in the class (shout out to Sweeney who now teaches there), also recognized this, and our programs were locked in a stalemate, each beating the other when they played first. But his code must have had a glitch or something, and after several games back and forth, I won as Player 2!

Check out player.cpp for details.

I was also working on optimal 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 play. It's implemented in the code, and you can still challenge the computer, but the play is sub-optimal. 

Edit: I'll include the makefile after I figure out how to do that.
